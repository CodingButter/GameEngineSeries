# Built From Scratch: 2D Game Engine â€” Episode 2 (Foundations & Renderer)

This branch tracks Episode 2 of the series and moves the project onto a BHVR-style monorepo (Bun, Hono, Vite, React). We also build the first engine module: a minimal Canvas 2D renderer, wire it to the React client, and prove hot reload across the workspace.

## Whatâ€™s in this branch

- **BHVR layout** with separate top-level apps and shared types:
  - `client/` â€” React app (the editor/frontend)
  - `server/` â€” Hono HTTP server (for later tooling/APIs)
  - `shared/` â€” shared types across client/server
  - `packages/renderer/` â€” Canvas 2D renderer module

(Structure verified on this branchâ€™s main view.)  
*Reference: repo shows `client`, `server`, `shared`, and `packages/renderer` at root, with root files `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `tsconfig.json`, and `turbo.json`.* :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Episode goals

- Transition from hand-wired setup to **BHVR workspace**.
- Create **`@ges/renderer`** with the bare essentials:
  - `clear(color)` to wipe the frame
  - `drawRect(x, y, w, h, color)` to render a simple rectangle
- Plug the renderer into the **React client** and confirm live reload.

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingButter/GameEngineSeries.git
cd GameEngineSeries
git checkout ep01-ch01-ep-02-foundations-renderer
bun install
bun run dev
````

This launches the client and links workspace packages so edits in `packages/renderer` live-reload in the browser.

## Repo structure (Episode 2)

```
.
â”œâ”€ client/                 # React frontend (editor)
â”œâ”€ server/                 # Hono backend (tooling/APIs; minimal in Ep2)
â”œâ”€ shared/                 # Shared TypeScript types
â”œâ”€ packages/
â”‚  â””â”€ renderer/            # Canvas 2D renderer (clear, drawRect)
â”œâ”€ package.json            # Workspaces + scripts
â”œâ”€ bun.lock
â”œâ”€ tsconfig.json
â””â”€ turbo.json
```

Top-level directories and files are visible in the repo root. ([GitHub][1])

## Renderer overview

A tiny, testable module you can import from the client:

```ts
export interface Renderer {
  clear(color?: string): void
  drawRect(x: number, y: number, w: number, h: number, color?: string): void
}
```

Implementation uses the Canvas 2D API and keeps the surface unopinionated so we can swap or extend later.

---

## Why this matters

* The **renderer** proves the BHVR setup is working end-to-end.
* The **workspace** separation (client/server/shared/packages) keeps boundaries clean as we add engine pieces.
* Hot reload + modular imports = faster iteration with fewer rebuilds.

---

## Whatâ€™s next (Episode 3)

* Add **core** and **engine** packages.
* Implement a real **update + render loop** with delta time.
* Drive the renderer through the engine and surface FPS in the UI.
